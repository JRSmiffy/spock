# Section 1: Introduction

<br>

## Overview
* The purpose of this repository is to encompass as much relevant Spock knowledge as I can
    * This includes notes taken from Rob Fletcher's 'Spock: Up & Running'
    * As well as, other bits of knowledge that I pick up over time from using Spock
* Rob Fletcher provides an accompanying [repository](https://github.com/robfletcher/spock-up-and-running) of examples:
    * It is worth getting to grips with these, so you can easily refer back when writting tests in the wild
* Note, I used the 2017 edition of this book:
    * The referenced Spock version is v1.1
        * At the time of writting these notes (late 2022), Spock has moved to v2.1
            * Consider looking at the release docs to see what has changed and updating these notes accordingly
