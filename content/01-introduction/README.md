# Section 1: Introduction

<br>

## Overview
* This primary purpose of this repository is to house notes taken from Rob Fletcher's 'Spock: Up & Running'
* An accompanying [repository](https://github.com/robfletcher/spock-up-and-running) containing the book's examples, as well as the Squawker application, is provided:
    * It is worth getting to grips with these examples, so you can easily refer back when writting tests in the wild
* Note, I used the 2017 edition of this book:
    * The referenced Spock version is v1.1
        * At the time of writting these notes (late 2022), Spock has moved to v2.1
        * It is worth having a look at the release notes to see what has changed
